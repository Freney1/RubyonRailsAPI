The Delirium Challenge League
Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!
You'll encounter the Mirror of Delirium in each area of the Delirium Challenge League. Upon touching the mirror, your reality will turn to mist and your nightmares will manifest. Inside the Delirium, deadly new monsters appear and existing foes become more dangerous. Pushing deeper into the Delirium will intensify its danger and grant even more rewards.
Among the spoils you may find Cluster Jewels. These new jewels are exclusively available from Delirium content and can only be socketed in the outer rim of your Passive Tree. Socketing one of these jewels will expand your tree to reveal brand new passive skills and notables and, if you're lucky, even new Keystones. Like other items in Path of Exile, Cluster Jewels can be crafted to modify their properties.
You may also acquire Delirium Orbs from high-level Delirium encounters. Delirium Orbs can be applied to maps, shrouding the whole map area in dangerous Delirium. You'll also find Delirium Splinters which can be combined to gain access to the Simulacrum. It is in the Simulacrum that you'll find Delirium's hardest and most rewarding fights.
With 3.10.0, there are Standard, Hardcore and Solo Self-Found variations of the Delirium challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items. You can create private league versions of these leagues, with mods that make the game harder.
The new challenge leagues include a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Delirium Horns. When you reach 24 challenges, you will receive the Delirium Cloak. At 36 challenge completed you'll receive the Delirium Wings. These microtransactions are only obtainable in this league.
From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Delirium Totem Pole decoration to display in your hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Delirium challenges you completed during the league.

Major New Content and Features
Added a new Intelligence Skill Gem - Arcane Cloak: Consumes a portion of your mana to gain a buff that can take a percent of damage from hits for you before being depleted. While the buff is active, you gain additional lightning damage based on the amount of mana consumed as part of the skill's effect. Shares a cooldown with other Guard skills.
Added a new Intelligence Skill Gem - Stormbind: Place a runic pattern on the ground which grows as you channel. The runes slow enemies that travel across them and deal damage in a circle when detonated by the Rune Blast skill. Rune Blast can be channelled to upgrade the placed runes. When Rune Blast is released, the runes will detonate.
Added a new Intelligence Skill Gem - Kinetic Bolt: Fire a wand attack that changes direction and releases additional projectiles at regular intervals.
Added a new Dexterity Skill Gem - Blade Blast: Detonate a blade at your targeted location. This detonation will spread to blades left by Ethereal Knives, Blade Vortex or Bladefall.
Added a new Intelligence Skill Gem - Spellslinger: While active, reserves mana for each linked spell and will cause those spells to trigger at the end of your attacks while wielding a wand.
Added a new Intelligence Support Gem - Archmage Support: Adds lightning damage to supported skills and changes their cost to a percentage of your unreserved mana, adding a portion of the new cost as added lightning damage.
Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence Support Gem - Second Wind Support: Adds an additional cooldown use to supported skills, and grants those skills increased cooldown recovery rate.
Added Cluster Jewels, a new type of jewel which can be socketed in the outer rim of the Passive Skill Tree, adding new Passive Skill options. These can only be obtained via Delirium content, and come in three different varieties. Large Cluster Jewels can (at higher item levels), have Medium Sockets in them, which can hold Medium Cluster Jewels. Medium Cluster Jewels can have Small Sockets, which can hold Small Cluster Jewels. Allocating passives on these jewels works just like allocating normal passives. If you want to refund passives allocated on these jewels, you only have to pay one Refund Point for the entire jewel. Note that you have to refund all passives on a jewel if you wish to remove the jewel from the tree.
Added the Simulacrum, an endgame encounter accessible by collecting Simulacrum Splinters from Delirium encounters. Take on a sequence of increasingly difficult fights for better and better rewards. How long can you last?
Added 16 new Unique Items, including one designed by one of our Supporters!
Added 8 new Divination Cards designed by our Supporters.
Added a new type of currency, Delirium Orbs, which can be applied to maps to plunge the entire area into Delirium. Each Orb also adds new rewards to the map, and each map can have up to five Delirum Orbs applied. Be careful, as each Orb will also make the map substantially more difficult.
Added 2 new Rogue Exiles, designed with input from our Talent Competition winners.

Minor New Content and Features
Made significant improvements to a number of Spectred monsters. Many monsters that couldn't be spectred previously now can, and many that previously only used their melee attacks in unlife will now use whatever special skills they had in life. Several Spectres that were dealing damage far above others have been toned down. We're looking at you, Atlas Influence monsters.
Improved the appearance of shocked, burning, caustic and chilled ground.
Added a stash to Einhar's Menagerie. You did it Reddit!!
Added 9 new Grandmasters to the Hall of Grandmasters and replaced 7 others.
Added 3D art for The Rotting Legion
Arctic Breath, Caustic Arrow, Frost Blades, Ice Nova, Molten Shell, Molten Strike and Scorching Ray have had visual upgrades.
Raised Zombies now use animations we created for Path of Exile 2.
Cremation's projectile impact area of effect is now more clearly portrayed visually.
You can once again sell three sextants of the same tier to a vendor for a sextant one tier higher.
Added an option to have your portal appearance randomly selected from all owned portal microtransactions. This applies not only to your portal to town but to your Map Device. In fact, you can have all 6 Map Device portals randomly selected, or have it randomly select one appearance for all six portals!
Added the capacity to raise hundreds of new monsters as Spectres, including those found from Atlas Influence and from league content such as Breach.
Added a background framerate cap option. This will limit the framerate of Path of Exile when it is not the current focus.
The unique Synthesis maps and unique Watchstones now have slots in the unique stash tab.
You will no longer be ambushed by Betrayal Interventionists or by Atlas Influence monsters while looking at your Betrayal board, the Incursion Temple panel, the Metamorph panel, the Anointment panel, or talking to an NPC.
Changed our anti-aliasing technique from MSAA to SMAA.
Improved engine multi-threading, and added support for 16 logical cores (previously 8), meaning Path of Exile can better utilise high-end CPUs now.
Charged, Enriched and Pure Breachstones now each have their own unique art.
Added new item filter drop effect colour options.
Added an arrow-shatter effect for arrows that neither bounce off a surface nor stick.
Improved the audio of all Warcries.

Atlas Changes
Since launching Conquerors of the Atlas, we've received a lot of great feedback about how the new Atlas of Worlds can be improved. We've made a number of improvements and will continue to do so.

Conqueror presence and their influence mechanics are now spawned deterministically, with progress between each influenced map tracked on the Atlas itself. You can see this on the lefthand side of the Atlas panel, connected to the Watchstone inventory.
The chance for a Conqueror to occupy an Atlas region is now 50% (from 33%), if the conditions are met.
Conquerors will now sometimes grant buffs to map bosses in their region.
Improvements have been made to how progress through the Conquerors of the Atlas quests are tracked. It should be significantly easier to see what your next steps are.
You can now clearly see which Watchstones have Sextants applied to them when they are in the Watchstone inventory.
Added a short Watchstone tutorial which takes you through how to use and store your Watchstones.
The Awakening Level of your Atlas is now the number of Watchstones you have socketed, divided by 4, and rounded down. In other words, you will now gain Awakening Levels gradually, rather than only when you fill a Watchstone Altar.
If you fail to defeat a Conqueror, you will no longer get additional monster packs or Influenced items from their Influenced region until you do defeat them.
Improved the visibility of active Conqueror Citadels on your Atlas.

Bonuses for completing Atlas Bonus Objectives and Awakening Bonus Objectives have changed:
You will no longer gain additional chance for maps to drop one tier higher from Awakening Bonus Objectives.
The base chance to gain an Atlas Mission upon map completion is now 35% (from 40%).
You will now gain 1% chance to gain an Atlas Mission upon map completion per 15 maps with the Awakening Bonus Objective complete.
You will now gain 1% increased Map Mod Effect per 6 maps with the Awakening Bonus Objective complete.

A number of changes have been made to the Sirus, Awakener of Worlds fight:
Sirus' Apparition is now more active during the arena phases.
Sirus now heals to 75% of his maximum life at the start of his final phase at Awakening level 8 (from 50%).
Sirus now teleports away from the player before using his Corridor skill. He takes 80% less damage during the Corridor skill, and the projectiles he fires now pierce all non-player targets.
The rotating quad-beam ability now has larger beams and applies a new debuff which reduces your action speed and causes you to take increased damage.

We've made changes to several Sextant modifiers that were overly rewarding:
The Unidentifed Map Sextant modifier now grants 20, 25 or 30% increased quantity of items found based on Sextant tier (from 25, 30 or 35%) and 9, 12 or 15% increased monster pack size based on Sextant tier (from 12, 15 or 18%).
The Sextant modifier that granted additional monster packs and increased the damage you take now grant 4, 6 or 8 additional packs based on Sextant tier (from 6, 8 or 10).
The Sextant modifier that populated maps with barrels now grants 15, 25 or 35 barrels based on Sextant tier (from 20, 30 or 40).

Return to top
Metamorph Mechanics Added to the Core Game
Metamorph, and Tane, can now be found once you reach maps. Each map has a 10% chance to be populated with monsters who can drop Metamorph parts. Tane will appear in your hideout once you have completed his Pound of Flesh quest. He will no longer appear in towns, misanthrope that he is.
You can now find Metamorph Scarabs from various sources. Each scarab guarantees Metamorph monsters will appear in an area, with higher-tier Scarabs causing map bosses to drop additional Metamorph parts.
Added a Sextant modifier which will also cause maps in the associated Atlas region to contain Metamorph monsters.
Made a number of improvements to specific Metamorph behaviour situations. For example, Metamorphs with only ranged skills will now still attempt to move closer to the player, whereas previously they would stand in place.
The "maximum power" effect on the bar to the right of the Metamorph panel no longer plays if it is impossible for the fight to drop an itemised organ.
Added a line to the reward box when the Metamorph will drop an itemised organ.

Return to top
Endgame Vaal Side Area Improvements
Vaal Side Areas found in maps and those created by placing individual Vaal fragments in the map device now count as map areas for the purposes of map drops and other mechanics which interact with map areas.
They now generate as 'rare' areas, meaning they will always have 4 to 6 modifiers on their area.
Vaal Side Areas opened via placing an individual fragment in the map device are now 1 level higher across the board.
The values on the area modifiers are now similar to those found on maps of a similar level.
Added many new mods that can appear on Vaal side areas, including several that can influence the items and rewards found in those areas.
Elemental and Physical Damage Reflection modifiers can no longer appear for these areas.
Increased the number of monsters found in all map-level Vaal side areas.
Monsters normally found in Incursion encounters will now also be found in Vaal side areas.
Side area bosses now have Life pools similar to other unique monsters found in maps.

Character Balance
Modifiers to Melee Weapon and Unarmed Attack Range are now described as "+X to Melee Strike Range". The functionality hasn't changed. Weapons that describe their range still refer to "Weapon Range".
Increases and reductions to reflected damage taken (such as the Sextant modifier or the Yugul God Power) now also affect your minions.
Wand attack projectiles are now considered larger for the purposes of collision detection against monsters.
Elusive now grants 30% increased movement speed (from 40%), 15% chance to dodge attacks (from 20%) and 15% chance to dodge spells (from 20%).
There is now a hard upper limit of 75% for chance to Avoid Damage from Hits (such as the fire damage avoidance found on Glitterdisc).
Scorch and Brittle (alternate ailments for Fire and Cold damage respectively) have both had their maximum effects raised. Scorch reduces elemental resistances by a maximum of 30% (from 20%). Brittle now increases the chance to critically strike an afflicted enemy by up to 15% (from 10%). Scorch, Brittle and Sap now all have a base duration of 4 seconds (from 2).

The "Enduring" modifier on mana flasks now has 30% reduced duration (from 25%) and now also has 30% reduced Amount Recovered. Flasks with this modifier are no longer queued while a stronger effect is active. Instead, the duration will continue to expire with no effect until the stronger flask effect ends or the Enduring flask's duration expires completely.

Fossil Crafting
We want crafting to be a way to get great items, but not the only way to get the very best items. Fossil Crafting in particular was the only way to obtain a large number of very desirable mods. We've done away with all Fossil-exclusive mods except those found on Faceted, Bloodstained and Hollow Fossils, and moved a number of them to other sources. These mods can still be obtained through Fossil crafting, as long as the base item also fulfills the mod's requirements.

Fossils can no longer craft any prefix or suffix mods that cannot be obtained elsewhere, with the exception of those granted by Faceted, Bloodstained and Hollow Fossils. Implicit modifiers (such as the one which changes an item's vendor sell price) remain. The following mods have been relocated, while all others can no longer be obtained:
On Boots: +2 to level of socketed Fire Gems (now from Warlord's Influence), +2 to level of socketed Cold Gems (now from Redeemer's Influence), +2 to level of socketed Lightning Gems (now from Crusader's Influence), +2 to level of socketed Chaos Gems (now from Hunter's Influence), +1 to global level of raised Spectres (now from Elder's Influence).
Helmet: Nearby Enemies have -x% Fire Resistance (now from Warlord's Influence), Nearby Enemies have -x% Cold Resistance (now from Redeemer's Influence), Nearby Enemies have -x% Lightning Resistance (now from Crusader's Influence), Nearby Enemies have -x% Chaos Resistance (now from Hunter's Influence), Nearby Enemies take x% increased Physical Damage (now from Elder's Influence), increased effect of Fortify (now from Crusader's Influence).
Body Armour: Socketed Attacks have -15 to Mana Cost (now from Warlord's Influence), x% increased Aura Effect on you (now from Redeemer's Influence).
Quiver: x% chance to gain a Frenzy Charge on hitting a Rare or Unique Enemy (now from Elder's Influence).
Belt: Increased Chaos Damage (now from Hunter's Influence), increased Physical Damage (now from Elder's Influence), increased Elemental Damage (now from Shaper's Influence), increased Energy Shield from Body Armour (now from Shaper's Influence, and now a Prefix), chance for double Armour Effect when hit (now from Elder's Influence, and now a Prefix).
Rings: Fire/Cold/Lightning/Physical/Chaos leech modifiers can now exclusively be found from special elemental Delve encounters.
Weapons: Socketed Attacks/Spells deal x% more Damage (now found from Shaper's Influence), chance for Poison/Bleeding inflicted with this weapon to deal more damage (now found from Elder's Influence), chance to Intimidate on Hit (now found from Hunter's Influence), Auras from your Skills grant increased Damage to you and Allies (now from Redeemer's Influence).
Jewels: Damage penetrates 1% Fire/Cold/Lightning/Elemental Resistance (now from Corrupted implicits).
Glove, Amulet and Shield Fossil-exclusive modifiers can no longer be obtained in any form. Existing items will be unchanged.

Unique Item Balance
Unique Watchstones always drop with a number of uses that is a multiple of 3.
The Saviour: Mirage Warriors created by this weapon can now consume charges to bypass cooldowns, if the skill they use has a cooldown that can be bypassed this way. For example, Flicker Strike Mirage Warriors will now consume Frenzy Charges until they run out, at which point they will only use Flicker Strike once the cooldown expires.

The Shaper's Presence buff granted by this item now grants -20% to buff expiration speed (from 33%).

Fevered Mind now increases the mana cost of skills by 50% (from 100%), and grants 30 to 40% increased Spell Damage (from 20 to 30%). This would affect existing items, except since they're all corrupted, you can't reroll them. Blame Atziri.

Bug Fixes
Fixed issues with environmental shadows not displaying correctly in some areas.
Fixed a bug where Piety's boss path in the Shaper's Realm would cause visual problems with terrain tiles.
Fixed bugs which caused Totem cosmetic effects to fire more slowly initially than the base Shrapnel Ballista model.
Fixed a bug where, while fighting an Elder Guardian, Lightning Warp supported by Greater Spell Echo could cause the player to become trapped in an inescapable arena.
Fixed a bug where you could select pets that were following you while editing your hideout.
Fixed a bug which caused the unique jewel Volley Fire to incorrectly grant Barrage additional projectiles on every arrow fired when supported by the Arrow Nova Support gem.
Fixed a bug which caused skills with damaging effects that were disconnected from the initial skill use (such as Molten Strike, Fire Storm, Wild Strike, and a number of others) which were supported by effects that triggered multiple successive uses of the skill (Multistrike, Greater Spell Echo and Unleash) to not apply the support gem's damage penalty or enhancement to those delayed effects, or even to the successive skill uses. This resulted in less damage being dealt by several skills when supported by Multistrike than they were intended to deal, and more damage by skills supported by Greater Spell Echo and Unleash.
Fixed a bug which caused Vaal Flameblast to always deal critical strikes. Still wasn't seeing much use though!
Fixed a bug where you could socket Watchstones into a Conqueror's citadel, even though the Conqueror was occupying it.

Fixed a bug where characters with Phasing would render behind track tiles in areas with tracks, such as the Pier map.
Fixed numerous cosmetic issues with effects clipping badly.

Fixed several bad interactions between the Illusionist Body Armour and Wings cosmetics.
Fixed a bug which caused passages that were meant to collapse in Abyss areas to not...? But also they did. But also they didn't. But they do now!
Baran, the Crusader's Mana Runes now match the terrain, rather than sticking halfway through the stairs a lot of the time.
Fixed a bug where the Eye of Malice on the Duelist and Templar was more like the Floating Blob of Malice.
Fixed some typos in Prophecy quest trackers.
Fixed several modifiers that weren't correctly improving with Turbulent Catalyst quality.
Fixed a bug which prevented Awakened Blasphemy Support from having any cosmetic microtransactions applied to it.

Fixed some bad interactions between the Basilisk Weapon Effect and other weapon cosmetics.
Fixed a bug which caused the impact sound from Wand Barrage to play at the wrong location.
Fixed a bug where Einhar forgot to put Trarthan powder in his secondary bombs, so they weren't exploding like they normally do. What a silly Einhar!
Fixed a number of skips and exploits in the Labyrinth.

Fixed a bug where some Delve bosses did not correctly cause the environment to transition between phases.
Removed the trail that was added to the Legion weapon effect after it was released. Sorry!

Fixed a bug in the Ralakesh encounter where a bandit could continuously fire arrows into the sky that never went away.
Fixed a bug where Mirage Warriors created by The Saviour would not attack your target if you were using a channelled ability (such as Cyclone).
Fixed a bug where critical hits from triggered skills such as Labyrinth glove enchantments could trigger The Saviour's effect, creating Mirage Warriors that did nothing. Now they are not created from skills they cannot use.
Fixed a bug which caused Blast Rain's tooltip to not update with additional arrows.
Fixed a bug where effects that would change the appearance of Frenzy/Power/Endurance charges would not work correctly if you had a source of Minimum charges.
